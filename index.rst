Neper is a free / open source software package for polycrystal generation and meshing.   It can be used to generate polycrystals with a wide variety of morphological properties, from very simple morphologies (simple tessellations, grain-growth microstructures, ...) to complex, mumtiphase or multiscale microstructures that involve grain subdivisions.  The resulting *tessellations* can be meshed into high-quality meshes suitable for finite-element simulations.

.. note::

  See also Neper's companion program, `FEPX <https://fepx.info>`_, a finite element software package for polycrystal plasticity.  FEPX acts as a simulation tool for Neper.

Neper is developed by Romain Quey at `CNRS <http://www.cnrs.fr/en>`_ and `Mines Saint-Etienne <https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/>`_.
