Generating a Regular Tessellation
=================================

Regular tessellations, for which all cells have the same shape, can be generated.  Available morphologies are squares in 2D, and cubes and truncated octahedra in 3D.

.. note::

  To reproduce *exactly* the images below, add the following line to your :file:`$HOME/.neperrc` file (or to a local configuration file to be loaded with :option:`--rcfile`)::

    neper -V -imagesize 800:400

Generating a Square-Cell Tessellation
-------------------------------------

A tessellation composed of :math:`4 \times 4 \times 4` squares can be generated as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  $ neper -T -n from_morpho -morpho "square(4)" -id 2 -dim 2 -o square4

This produces a :ref:`tess_file` named :file:`square4.tess`.

The tessellation can be visualized using the :ref:`neper_v`:

.. code-block:: console

  $ neper -V square4.tess -print img1

.. image:: regular_tess/img1.png

.. [CMAME2011] :ref:`px`.
